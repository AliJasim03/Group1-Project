<!-- Explanation:
1. <!DOCTYPE html> declares the document type as HTML5.
2. The <html> tag is the root element of the HTML document.
3. The <head> section contains meta-information about the HTML document, including the title and links to stylesheets.
4. The <body> section contains the content of the HTML document that will be displayed in the browser.
5. <h1> and <h2> tags are used for headings.
6. <table> is used to create a table for displaying the employee list.
7. <thead> contains the table header, and <tbody> will be populated with rows by JavaScript.
8. <label>, <input>, and <button> are used to create a form for fetching an employee by ID.
9. <div> elements with IDs "employeeDetails" and "errorDiv" are used to display employee details and error messages, respectively.
10. The <script> tag links to an external JavaScript file that will add interactivity to the page.

Note: Spring Boot will serve this HTML file because it's located in the static folder. Any files placed in the static folder are automatically served by Spring Boot when the application runs.
